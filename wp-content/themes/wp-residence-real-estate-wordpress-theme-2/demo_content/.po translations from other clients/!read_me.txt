Copy only the .po and .mo file to wpresidence/languages folder

To update the translation to include new words which we may have added since these .po files were created, follow 
these steps:

1. Install Codestyle Localization plugin
2. Rescan the language .po from Tools – Localizations (it’s the file under WPRESIDENCE)
3. search for the word you wish to translate and make sure you either type exactly the word with caps or check the capitalization checkbox to have all results
4. Translate
5. Click generate mo file button from the plugin settings.

If translation is not applying, it means you need to check the new WordPress 4 rules:
