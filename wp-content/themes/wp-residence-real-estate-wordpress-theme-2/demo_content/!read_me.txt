---------1. Import separately post, pages, agents

If you choose to import only post, pages or agents from demo, you will import only text (not images). If you need images,
import full demo (please note you need a good hosting service to upload all content at once)


--------- 2. Import full content


Note that this file is large because we include all images from the demo, which are in high resolution. If during the import
